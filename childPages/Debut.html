            <p>"Taylor Swift" was Taylor's very first studio album. It released in 2006 with inspirations from Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks. 
            It was released by Big Machine Records (who Taylor no longer works with) and she only released this album when she ws 16 years old! 
            The album circles around Taylor being a small town girl with average teenage girl feelings for averager teenage boys. 
            Her lead single for the album was titled "Tim McGraw" and is the song that made country fans around the world love her.

            This album speaks of love, heartbreak, and teenage angst. Most of these songs originate from her diary as her experiances are very personal.

            "Tim McGraw" is one of her most critically praised songs on the album as it's loved by many country fans despite their hate for Taylor Swift
            if it was even there! She wrote the song in her freshman year of highschool and its about her senior boyfriend, Brando Borello.
            She knew that he would end up breaking up with her before he left for college and Taylor wanted to a write a song to commemorate the relationship.
