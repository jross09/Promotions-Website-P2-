            Fearless is Taylor Swift's second studio album. The album was published by Big Machine Records in the winter of 2008. 
            This album focuses on the country aspect of Swift's early career. The album features Liz Rose, Hillary Lindsay, Colbie Caillat, and John Rich.
            The number one single for this album was the song "Love Story". The aspects of this song had to do with a story about a boy and a girl who are 
            forbidden to be together, much like the Shakespear play literature.
            <br>
            In Taylor Swift's words:
            <br>
            This is a song I wrote when I was dating a guy who wasn't exactly the popular choice.
            His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care. I started this song with the line, 
            'This love is difficult, but it's real.' When I wrote the ending to this song, I felt like it 
            was the ending every girl wants to go with her love story. It's the ending that I want. You want 
            a guy who doesn't care what anyone thinks, what anyone says. He just says, 'Marry me, Juliet, I love you, 
            and that's all I really know.' It's sort of told in a character kind of thing, where it's Romeo and Juliet,
            and it's not me saying that I'm getting married or anything...but I think it's fun to write about it.
