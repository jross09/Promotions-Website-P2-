# About The Author
- Nationality: Canadian
- Ethnicity: Trinidadian and Laotian
- Country: 
- Language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lebFgTHooNE 
- I speak English at school and at home mixed with some Laos to my Grandparents too. 
- Birth Place: I was born in St. Albert in the Royal Alexandria Hospital
- Full Name: My full name is Jaden Alexus Ross. It is just considered my name and not my English name because I was not given a name in another language.
- Nick names: My friends don't have any nick names for me but my family calls me just "Jay" when they're calling me so it doesn't take as much time.
Culture & Customs Examples: Some custom examples for my Laos side is going to the temple with my Grandma and Mom for Laos New Year and seeing all of my family. Customs examples for my Trinidadian side is going to Cariwest with my Dad and participating in the parade. Another custom for this side is deciding to clean at 7am on a Saturday to clean the whole house so loud the neighbours can hear you.
